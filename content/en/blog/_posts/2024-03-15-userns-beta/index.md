title: "Kubernetes 1.30: User-namespace hits Beta!"

Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. A
typical Kubernetes pod runs with a network namespace, to isolate the network
identity, a PID namespace, to isolate the processes, etc.

One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user namespace. This namespace
allows to isolate the UIDs and GIDs we use inside the container from the ones on
the host.

This is a powerful abstraction that allows to run containers as "root": we are
root inside the container and we can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great to limit the impact of a container breakout.

In Kubernetes v1.25 we introduced support for user namespaces for only stateless
pods. Kubernetes 1.28 lifted that restriction and now, with Kubernetes 1.30, we
are moving to beta!

## What is a user namespace?

A user namespace is a Linux feature that isolates the user and group identifiers
(UIDs and GIDs) of the containers from the ones on the host. The identifiers in
the container can be mapped to identifiers on the host in a way where the host
UID/GIDs used for different containers never overlap. Furthermore, the
identifiers can be mapped to unprivileged non-overlapping UIDs and GIDs on the
host. This brings two key benefits:

 * _Prevention of lateral movement_: As the UIDs and GIDs for different
containers are mapped to different UIDs and GIDs on the host, containers have a
harder time attacking each other even if they escape the container boundaries.
For example, if container A is running with different UIDs and GIDs on the host
than container B, the operations it can do on container Bâ€™s files and process
are limited: only read/write what a file allows to others, as it will never
have permission owner or group permission (the UIDs/GIDs on the host are
guaranteed to be different for different containers).

 * _Increased host isolation_: As the UIDs and GIDs are mapped to unprivileged
users on the host, if a container escapes the container boundaries, even if it
is running as root inside the container, it has no privileges on the host. This
greatly protects what host files it can read/write, which process it can send
signals to, etc. Furthermore, capabilities granted are only valid inside the
user namespace and not on the host, which also limits the impact a container
escape can have.

Without using a user namespace, a container running as root in the case of a
container breakout, has root privileges on the node. And if some capabilities
were granted to the container, the capabilities are valid on the host too. None
of this is true when using user namespaces (modulo bugs, of course ðŸ™‚).

## Changes in 1.30

The only change in Kubernetes 1.30, besides moving to Beta, is that we now allow
the kubelet to use custom ranges fod the UIDs/GIDs mapping.

See the documentation for how to use it.

## Demo

A few weeks ago, [CVE-2024-21626][runc-cve] was disclosed. This **vulnerability
score is 8.6 (HIGH)** and allows an attacker to escape a container and
**read/write to any path on the node and other pods hosted on the same node**.

Rodrigo created a demo which exploits [CVE 2024-21626][runc-cve] and shows how
the exploit that works without user namespaces, **it is mitigated when user
namespaces are in use.**

Please note that with user namespaces we can do on the host file-system what the
permission bits for "others" allows us.

## Node system requirements

There are requirements on the Linux kernel version as well as the container
runtime to use this feature.

On Linux you need Linux 6.3 or greater. This is because the feature relies on a
kernel feature named idmap mounts, and support to use idmap mounts with tmpfs
was merged in Linux 6.3.

If you are using [CRI-O][crio] with crun, as always you can expect support for
Kubernetes 1.30 with CRI-O 1.30. Please note you also need [crun][crun] 1.9 or
greater.  If you are using CRI-O with [runc][runc], this is still not supported.

containerd support is currently targeted for [containerd][containerd] 2.0 and
the same crun version requirements apply. If you are using containerd with runc,
this is still not supported.

Please note that containerd 1.7 added _experimental_ support for user
namespaces as implemented in Kubernetes 1.25 and 1.26. We did a redesign in
Kubernetes 1.27, which requires changes in the container runtime. Those changes
are not present in containerd 1.7, so it only works in terms of user namespaces
support, with Kubernetes 1.25 and 1.26.

Another limitation present in containerd 1.7 is that it needs to change the
ownership of every file and directory inside the container image, during Pod
startup. This means it has a storage overhead and can significantly impact the
container startup latency. Containerd 2.0 will probably include a implementation
that will eliminate the startup latency added and the storage overhead. Take
this into account if you plan to use containerd 1.7 with user namespaces in
production.

None of these containerd 1.7 limitations apply to CRI-O.
